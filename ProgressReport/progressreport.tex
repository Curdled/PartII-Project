My project is on schedule, I have completed all work packages scheduled to be completed by 15/02/17.




 \section*{Success Criteria}

  The following criteria have bee achieved:

  \begin{itemize}

    \item
      I have created unit tests which test simple Haskell programs, making sure the valid programs compile
      and produce the correct result and invalid programs will not compile and produce errors related to the 
      problem with the input program. 
      
      These test come in the form of validation of individual stages in the compiler to test the
      these stages in isolation. 
      I have tests checking:
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Parsing of simple Haskell source.
        \item Checking the desugaring of the syntax from the parse tree to an intermediate representation
              is valid.
        \item If typeable and untypeable programs have correct typing judgments when run through 
          the type checker, also checking that for typeable programs the type checker returns the correct
          and most general type for that expression.
        \item The System F like core calculus (called Core) 
          output from the type-checking algorithm is annotated with the correct types.
        \item The JVM bytecode outputted from the code generation stage of the compiler will execute 
          and the correct output values printed inside the IO monad and return value is observed is
          the correct value for that program.
      \end{itemize}

      I have created tests checking the validity of extensions:
      As well as core requirements I have implement all of my extension tasks and have tests checking:
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Function inlining doesn't change the semantics of the program
        \item Checking that functions implemented in Java without side effect can be invoked by 
              Haskell code.
        \item Checking that calling monad IO function such as \texttt{putInt} function
          in the correct manor.
      \end{itemize}

      I have started implementing analysis feature I have created a profiler that will measure the 
      run time of a given program multiple times.
