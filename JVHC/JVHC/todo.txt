1) Check the fix in TyAppFixer and clean up the code. (Done)
2) Remove CoreExprFixer. (Done)

3) I need change the way Pipeline works 
4) Add build in types to type checker. (Done)
5) Need to change DataType and DataCon to be useful!

6) I need to fix the bound stuff in the TyAppFixer since the only allowing application of unbound types
   to variables missed many cases. (THINK this is done)

7) --Need to allow data constructors to be used as function in the Pipeline.Compiler function.
   --By adding the constructors with a new type. Cannot log const in tiExpr since will get the same
   --type which will muck up when doing the Fixer app step. This will work it you use unique type variables 
   Above i think is not true
