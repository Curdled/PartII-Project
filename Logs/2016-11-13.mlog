Been looking at the 'Typing Haskell in Haskell' (thih) paper.
This presented an algorithm for typing Haskell, which I adaped, removing 
type classes since my implementation didn't support them (maybe I should have
included them).

Also need to add kind inference which would work similar to type inference, 
but instead of using expression we use data types.
