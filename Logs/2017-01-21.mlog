Worked on inlining. Struggled to create verifiable JVM bytecode, the problem was
StackMap variables were uninitialized, fixed by adding gconv in the correct place 
to add extra entries in the StackMap.

Allowed partial inlining for mutually recursive functions. 

Implemented case reduction for literal case expressions. Going from 
  'case 2 of {2 -> e} ===> e'

Tested all of this using odd and even which only converge if the input is >0 and even if passed to even and 
odd is passed to odd.
