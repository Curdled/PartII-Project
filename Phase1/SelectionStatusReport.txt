Subject: Phase 1 - Isaacs: Haskell to JVM bytecode compiler

Phase 1 Project Selection Status Report

Name: Joe Isaacs

College: Sidney Sussex College (SID)

User Identifier: josi2

Director of Studies: John Fawcett (jkf21)

1. Please write 100 words on your current project ideas.
In this project I will be implementing a compiler for a subset of Haskell98.
I will output JVM bytecode (.class files) from Haskell source files.
I will use a pipeline compiler architecture, the parts of the pipeline will include:
  - Lexer/Parser.
  - Variable renamer.
  - Type checking.
  - Syntactic desugaring.
  - Typed core (https://ghc.haskell.org/trac/ghc/wiki/Commentary/Compiler/CoreSynType).
  - Code generation.
This is very similar to how GHC compiles Haskell (https://ghc.haskell.org/trac/ghc/wiki/Commentary/Compiler/HscMain).

I will include in my subset of Haskell98:
   - Type classes.
   - ADTs.
   - Type inference.
   - Integers.
   - Functions (including lambda).
   - Case expression.
   - Modules.

Extensions could include: IO (using monads), a Java monad that would allow Java Haskell interop. A GHCi like REPL using
the JVM as a backend. Implementation some intermediate optimisations in the typed core language.


2. Please list names of potential project supervisors.

3. Is there any chance that your project will involve any
computing resources other than the Computing Service's MCS and
software that is already installed there, for example: your own
machine, machines in College, special peripherals, imported
software packages, special hardware, network access, substantial
extra disc space on the MCS.

If so indicate below what, and what it is needed for.
I will use my own personal laptop (late 2013 MacBook Pro).
I will use Github for source control and backup. I will also backup
to Dropbox.
I will use Haskell, which means I will use the GHC and associated libraries.
I will use the already existing libraries including Alex (lexer generator similar to lex),
Happy (parser generator similar to yacc), codec-jvm (a JVM bytecode generator).
